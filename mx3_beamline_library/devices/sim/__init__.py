"""This directory contains simulated device instation specific to this beamline.
Filenames should match the real device instantion file names. This simulation
could be achieved via simulation at the ophyd layer or simulated IOCs
(e.g., with caproto) external to the beamline library. Tools for automated
mocking/generation of simulated devices could be explored, or methods for
switching between mock and real PVs for the case of simulated IOCs.
